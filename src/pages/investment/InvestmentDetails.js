												Our Investment Program is sub-divided into two parts:
												the internal capital projects investment and the
												external investment.
											</p>
											<br />
											<br />
											<h5>Internal Capital Projects Investment</h5>
											<p>
												For both new buildings and renovations, the Office of
												Capital Projects (OCP) provides leadership and
												experience to oversee capital projects from design to
												construction and delivery. We serve as a link between
												the project's supporting university department and the
												remaining project team, which includes designers,
												architects, engineers, and constructors. We also supply
												the lovely interior design and furniture layouts that
												you see in our structures. Many in our group bring
												specific sustainability knowledge and have been
												recognized as professionals in addition to leading
												project teams and monitoring project progress.
												<br />
												<br />
												This office would also provide property development and
												project management services. To fulfil the requirements
												of our students, professors, and staff, we shall
												frequently collaborate with other firms to build,
												manage, and provide real estate assets. Traditional
												project team structures are considered, as well as the
												ones that are only available on a project-by-project
												basis. Administrative buildings, residential
												developments, and multi-user projects are all part of
												the portfolio.

												We have been instrumental and supportive in managing all
												the capital projects donated to Summit from different
												organizations and bodies.

											<h5>Internal Capital Projects Investment</h5>
											<p>
												The endowment of Summit University will be mostly
												invested with external investment managers and passive
												indices. An investment manager, which can be a company
												or an individual, invests on behalf of its clients in
												public equities, private enterprises, credit
												instruments, and real estate.
												<br />
												<br />
												Summit's external managers buy and sell investments as
												needed, as well as evaluate the overall performance of
												the funds they manage, to meet their customers'
												investment objectives and parameters. The Endowment
												Office recruits and supervises these outside investment
												managers based on the university's asset allocation,
												liquidity, and risk standards.

													Purpose. While The Vast Majority Of Summit's Endowment
